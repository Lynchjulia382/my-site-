        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p> Frédéric Cuvier, a French zoologist called them the most beautiful animal he had ever seen and named it Ailurus fulgens, meaning fire-colored, or shining, cat. The common name, panda, may be derived from a Nepalese name for these animals, nigalya ponya, which may have meant 'bamboo footed.'</p>

        <h2>Eyesight</h2>
        <p>Red Pandas has reddish-brown "tear marks" that extend from the eyes to the corner of the mouth. These markings could have evolved to help keep the sun out of their eyes. They also have very good night vision.</p>
